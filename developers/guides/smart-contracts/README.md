# Smart Contracts

In Partisia Blockchain there are two types of contracts, there are user based smart contracts which you compile and deploy yourself and there are the system contracts. To get an overview of the system contracts you can visit our [governance contracts overview](https://partisiablockchain.gitlab.io/documentation/pbc-fundamentals/governance-system-smart-contracts-overview.html).

In this section of smart contracts you can explore how to create your own contract. The specifications behind smart contracts. How to compile and deploy smart contracts on the testnet and mainnet and what zero knowledge smart contracts are. If you are in need of help when developing smart contracts, we recommend you visit [our support page or join the active community](https://partisiablockchain.gitlab.io/documentation/get-support-from-pbc-community.html)
