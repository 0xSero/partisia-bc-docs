## Introduction to Partisia Blockchain

Welcome to Partisia Blockchain, the world's first public blockchain with native support for secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). This platform combines the transparency and immutability of blockchain with privacy-preserving computation capabilities, creating a unique environment for building privacy-first applications.

### What is Partisia Blockchain?

Partisia Blockchain offers a decentralized infrastructure that enables:

* **Privacy-preserving applications** that can perform computations on sensitive data without revealing it
* **Public and private smart contracts** working in tandem
* **Cross-chain interoperability** through our [Bring Your Own Coin (BYOC) ](../guides/byoc/)mechanism
* **Scalable architecture** with sharding for high throughput

### Why Choose Partisia Blockchain?

#### Unique Privacy Features

While most blockchains force a choice between transparency and privacy, Partisia Blockchain enables both. Using zero-knowledge proofs and MPC, applications can process encrypted data and produce verifiable results without exposing sensitive information.

#### Decoupled Token Economy

Our innovative token model separates node operations (using MPC tokens for staking) from transaction payments[ (using BYOC)](../guides/byoc/). This approach ensures stable transaction costs regardless of token price fluctuations.

#### Enterprise-Ready

Partisia Blockchain is built on years of real-world experience implementing MPC solutions for enterprises. The platform brings this enterprise-grade technology to the public blockchain space.

### Use Cases

Partisia Blockchain enables new categories of applications:

* **Privacy-preserving DeFi** with hidden order books and anti-front-running
* **Confidential voting systems** with verifiable results
* **Data marketplaces** that protect both buyer and seller interests
* **Cross-chain applications** that leverage multiple blockchain ecosystems
