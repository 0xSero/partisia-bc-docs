# Getting Started

## Getting Started with Partisia Blockchain

### Introduction

Welcome to Partisia Blockchain, the first public blockchain with native secure **Multi-Party Computation (MPC)** capabilities. Partisia Blockchain combines the transparency and immutability of traditional blockchains with advanced privacy-preserving computation features, enabling a new generation of applications that require both public verification and data confidentiality.

{% hint style="info" %}
[**What is Multi-Party Computation (MPC)?**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation)

MPC refers to cryptographic protocols that allow multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. This enables calculations on encrypted data without exposing the underlying information to any participant‚Äîincluding the computation nodes themselves.
{% endhint %}

### Core Features & Capabilities

Partisia Blockchain stands out with several distinctive features that power its ecosystem:

#### 1. Privacy-First Architecture

* **Privacy-Preserving Computations**: Process sensitive data while maintaining confidentiality
* **Hybrid Contract System**: Deploy both public and private (ZK) smart contracts
* **Selective Disclosure**: Control exactly what information becomes public

#### 2. Innovative Token Economy

* **Dual Token Model**: [MPC tokens](broken-reference) for staking and governance; [BYOC (Bring Your Own Coin)](../guides/byoc/) for transaction fees
* **Gas Stability**: [Transaction costs fixed](../guides/gas/) in fiat value rather than fluctuating with token price
* **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Bridge assets from other blockchains

#### 3. Enterprise-Grade Performance

* **Complete Sharding**: Horizontal scaling for high transaction throughput
* **FastTrack Consensus**: Optimistic execution with rapid finality
* **Security Guarantees**: Cryptographic verification of all computation results
