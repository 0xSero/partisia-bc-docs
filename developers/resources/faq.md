# FAQ

## General Information

#### What is Partisia Blockchain?

Partisia Blockchain is a public blockchain built with privacy at its core through the integration of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology. It allows both transparent and confidential smart contracts, enabling applications that can compute on encrypted data without revealing the underlying information.

#### How does Partisia Blockchain differ from other blockchains?

Unlike most blockchains where all data is publicly visible, Partisia Blockchain incorporates privacy-preserving computations through MPC technology. This allows developers to build applications that can process sensitive data while maintaining confidentiality. It offers a hybrid architecture with both public and private smart contracts.

#### When was Partisia Blockchain launched?

Partisia Blockchain's mainnet was launched in 2021, after years of research and development in MPC technology.

### Technology

#### What is Multi-Party Computation (MPC)?

Multi-Party Computation is a cryptographic technique that allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. In the context of Partisia Blockchain, MPC enables computational processes on encrypted data without revealing the underlying information to any participant in the network.

#### How does zero-knowledge proof integrate with Partisia?

Partisia Blockchain utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to verify the correctness of computations without revealing the actual data. This complements the MPC technology by providing cryptographic proof that a computation was performed correctly while maintaining privacy.

#### What consensus mechanism does Partisia Blockchain use?

Partisia Blockchain uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism with a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) variation. This allows token holders to stake their tokens and participate in network security and governance.

#### What programming languages are supported for developing on Partisia?

Partisia Blockchain supports Rust for public smart contracts and a specialized MPC language for confidential smart contracts. The platform also provides SDKs and APIs for developers to integrate with various applications.

### Tokenomics

#### What is the native token of Partisia Blockchain?

The native token of Partisia Blockchain is MPC (Multi-Party Computation). It's used for transaction fees, staking, governance, and as a utility token within the ecosystem.

#### What is the total supply of MPC tokens?

The total supply of MPC tokens is capped at 100 million.

#### How can I stake my MPC tokens?

You can stake your MPC tokens through the official Partisia Blockchain wallet or supported third-party wallets. Staking allows you to earn rewards and participate in network governance.

### Use Cases

#### What are the main use cases for Partisia Blockchain?

Partisia Blockchain is designed for use cases requiring privacy while benefiting from blockchain transparency, including:

* Decentralized Finance (DeFi) with privacy features
* Healthcare data processing without exposing personal information
* Supply chain management with selective data disclosure
* Digital identity solutions with user-controlled data sharing
