### Token unlocking on mainnet

The token unlocking on mainnet comprises tokens allocated and unlocked within the four overall token pools: Sales, Ecosystem, Team and Reserve. A specially designed governance smart contract is used to allocate tokens to the different pools with programmed time-dependent unlocking and the total allocation is limited to the total supply.

The sales and team pool comprises 750 million $MPC tokens in total. These tokens are dedicated to fundraising efforts and team members. The presale and team allocation and unlock for these tokens follow the tokenomics schedule below where the majority of tokens unlock over the course of four years. By the end of July 2024, the total allocation for this category is approximately 513.5 million $MPC tokens, with around 125.5 million $MPC unlocked by the end of July 2024 (Q4).\


### Ecosystem tokens unlocking schedule

The ecosystem pool comprises 200 million $MPC tokens in total, which is split in two equally sized parts with 100 million $MPC tokens in each:

**Part 1:** These tokens are dedicated bootstrapping operations of the network in the form of rewards for staking. The allocation and unlock for these tokens follow the rewards distribution outlined in our Gitlab repository. A total of 100 million $MPC tokens are dedicated to this category and by the end of July 2024 approximately 13 million $MPC tokens are allocated and unlocked.

**Part 2:** These tokens are dedicated to the broader ecosystem support. The allocation and unlocking of these tokens follows a series of agreements covering things, such as developer grants, exchange advisory, market infrastructure and liquidity. A total of 100 million $MPC tokens are dedicated to this category, and by the end of July 2024 approximately 40,7 million $MPC are allocated and around 38,5 million $MPC unlocked. Approximately 70% of these tokens are market infrastructure and liquidity.

### On-chain liquidity measure

The reported circulating supply on CoinMarketCap is an on-chain measure of all unlocked tokens.This number changes over time so here we consider the circulating supply at the end of July 2024. The above numbers sum up to 177 million unlocked $MPC tokens, which is approximately 18 million $MPC less than what is reported as circulating supply on CoinMarketCap by the end of July 2024.

The difference concern the the sales and team pool and it is made up by the following:

* 12,5 million $MPC team tokens are locked off-chain by contractual commitment.
* Approximately 3,15 million $MPC tokens extra released from the public sales, as the public sale was not part of the paused unlocking.
* The last part are tokens that concern additional sales and deviations in the  implementation of different agreements.
