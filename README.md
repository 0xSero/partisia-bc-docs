# Getting Started

## Partisia Blockchain offers trust, transparency, privacy, and speed-of-light finalization. It is a pioneering technology that redefines how we approach privacy and scalability on the blockchain.

What sets Partisia Blockchain apart is its unique combination of advanced cryptographic techniques and distributed computing principles. By leveraging secure multiparty computation (MPC), Partisia Blockchain ensures privacy preservation without sacrificing efficiency or security.

This groundbreaking approach allows for confidential transactions, where sensitive data remains encrypted throughout the process, making it ideal for industries like finance, healthcare, and many others. Moreover, Partisia Blockchainâ€™s scalable architecture enables high transaction throughput, making it suitable for decentralized real-world applications.

Read our official documentation, where we introduce key concepts, create new node operators, onboard new external developers into the environment, and teach you how to code smart contracts on Partisia Blockchain.
