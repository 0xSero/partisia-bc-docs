# Our Roadmap

### Overview

Partisia Blockchain follows a phase-based development roadmap, progressing from Beta to Epsilon Mainnet between 2021 and 2025. The roadmap focuses on three key areas:

1. Scalability and Basic Blockchain Infrastructure
2. Privacy and Smart Contract Language
3. Interoperability and Bridges
